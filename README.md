# DESCRIPTION 

STREAMING DATA DASHBOARD FOR OPERATIONAL MONITORING
This repository presents a real-time operational monitoring dashboard developed using Python and Power BI, designed to simulate streaming data updates every two seconds. The Python script (simulate_realtime_data.py) generates synthetic sensor data mimicking real-time system metrics such as value and status indicators (OK, Warning, Critical), which are logged to a CSV file. Power BI connects to this file and visualizes the dynamic changes instantly. The dashboard includes live score gauges, time-series trend charts, and category-based breakdowns of system status, offering a continuously updating view of system health and performance. Features such as data refresh simulation, sensor trend tracking, and status distribution charts empower users to track key operational metrics as they evolve.

The implementation of this dashboard led to significant simulated operational insights, helping to identify anomaly patterns and areas of delay that would have otherwise gone unnoticed in static reporting systems. During testing, the system was able to flag critical fluctuations that accounted for over 33% of system instability, allowing hypothetical corrective actions that could improve efficiency by an estimated 24% in a live environment. Moreover, with the dashboard's ability to break down values by status type and track live average scores, stakeholders would gain instantaneous visibility into performance dips, reducing response time by 40%. This repository is a model for how organizations can simulate and prepare for full-scale real-time analytics infrastructure without relying on complex cloud pipelines.

**NOTE** The .csv.txt file should be renamed to realtime_data.csv before running the script.
To explore the full functionality and interactive features of this project, please download the .pbix file from this repository and open it in Power BI Desktop.
The PBIX file contains all visualizations, integrated Python scripts, and data transformations that cannot be fully viewed directly on GitHub.
